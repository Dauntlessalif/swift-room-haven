# ChatBot Enhancements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the hotel chatbot with improved UI/UX, additional features, and better positioning to prevent input cutoff issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Input Box Cutoff Issue ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The input box was getting cut off at the bottom of the chatbot window.
