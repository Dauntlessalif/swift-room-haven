## üîí Security Notes

### Current Implementation (Demo)
- Simple password authentication (`admin123`)
- Client-side validation only
- No user sessions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è For Production Use:
You **MUST** implement proper authentication:

1. **Use Supabase Auth**:
```typescript
// Example implementation
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';

const signIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email,
    password,
  });
};
```

2. **Add Row Level Security (RLS)**:
```sql
-- Example: Only authenticated users can access
CREATE POLICY "Admin access only" ON bookings
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

3. **Use Environment Variables**:
```typescript
const ADMIN_EMAIL = import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL;
```

4. **Add Session Management**:
- JWT tokens
- Refresh tokens
- Session timeout
- Logout functionality

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Guide

### Change Admin Password
Edit `src/pages/Admin.tsx`:
```typescript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'your-secure-password-here'; // Line 14
```

### Modify Auto-Refresh Interval
Edit `src/components/admin/DashboardOverview.tsx`:
```typescript
refetchInterval: 30000, // Change to desired milliseconds
```

### Customize Table Columns
Each management component has a `<Table>` section where you can add/remove columns.

### Add New Admin Sections
1. Create new component in `src/components/admin/`
2. Import in `src/pages/Admin.tsx`
3. Add new `<TabsTrigger>` and `<TabsContent>`

---

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

The admin panel is fully responsive:
- **Desktop** (‚â•1024px): Full layout with all features
- **Tablet** (768px-1023px): Optimized grid layouts
- **Mobile** (<768px): Stacked layouts with horizontal scroll for tables

---

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Confirming Multiple Bookings
```
1. Go to Bookings tab
2. Filter by "pending"
3. For each booking:
   - Click status dropdown
   - Select "confirmed"
```

### Example 2: Adding Multiple Rooms
```
1. Go to Rooms tab
2. Click "Add Room" for each room
3. Fill in details
4. Toggle availability as needed
```

### Example 3: Daily Message Review
```
1. Go to Messages tab
2. Filter by "new"
3. Click eye icon to read each
4. Update status to "replied" or "archived"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: TypeScript errors in admin components
**Solution**: The app will still work! TypeScript strict mode causes some warnings with Supabase types. These don't affect functionality.

### Issue: Data not loading
**Solution**: 
1. Check `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
2. Verify Supabase project is active
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Try clicking the Refresh button

### Issue: Can't delete items
**Solution**:
1. Verify Supabase RLS policies allow deletions
2. Check for foreign key constraints
3. Ensure item isn't referenced elsewhere

---

## üìä Database Schema Used

The admin panel interacts with these tables:
- `rooms` - Room listings
- `guests` - Customer information
- `bookings` - Reservations
- `contact_messages` - Customer inquiries
- `pet_care_requests` - Pet service requests
- `reviews` - Customer feedback

All tables have RLS policies configured in your database schema.

---

## üöÄ Performance Tips

1. **Use Filters**: Don't load all data at once
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old messages and reviews
3. **Monitor Dashboard**: Keep eye on system metrics
4. **Bulk Updates**: Handle similar items together
5. **Search First**: Use search before scrolling
