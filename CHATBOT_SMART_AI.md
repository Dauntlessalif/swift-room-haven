## 🧠 AI Intelligence Features

### Intent Detection Algorithm
```typescript
const detectIntent = (message: string) => {
  // Analyzes message against 15+ intent categories
  // Scores based on keyword matches
  // Returns top intent with confidence level
  // Extracts entities (dates, numbers, room types)
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Converts message to lowercase
2. Checks against keyword arrays for each intent
3. Calculates match scores
4. Identifies highest scoring intent
5. Extracts relevant entities
6. Returns structured intent object

### Smart Response Generation
```typescript
const getSmartResponse = async (message: string) => {
  // Detects intent
  // Queries database if needed
  // Generates contextual response
  // Includes relevant quick actions
  // Updates conversation context
}
```

**Response Types:**
- **Static Information**: Pre-formatted responses for policies, contact, etc.
- **Dynamic Data**: Real-time queries for availability, pricing
