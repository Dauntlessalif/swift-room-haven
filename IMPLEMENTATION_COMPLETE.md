## 🔧 Technical Details

### Implementation Highlights

1. **Auth Integration**
```typescript
import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";
const { user } = useAuth();
```

2. **Auto-Population**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    setGuestDetails({
      firstName: user.user_metadata?.first_name || "",
      lastName: user.user_metadata?.last_name || "",
      email: user.email || "",
      phone: user.user_metadata?.phone || "",
      address: user.user_metadata?.address || "",
    });
  }
}, [user, isOpen]);
```

3. **Conditional UI**
```typescript
{!user && (
  // Show full form with all input fields
)}

{user && (
  // Show read-only display of info
)}
```

4. **Backend Integration**
```typescript
const guest = await guestsApi.createOrGetGuest({
  id: user?.id,  // ✅ User's UUID
  first_name: guestDetails.firstName,

  phone: guestDetails.phone,
  address: guestDetails.address,
