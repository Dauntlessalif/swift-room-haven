# üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup Instructions - Room Data Migration

## üìã Overview
The room data has been migrated from hardcoded arrays to Supabase database for better scalability and management.

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Run the SQL in Supabase

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

2. **Copy & Paste the SQL**
   - Open the file: `INSERT_ROOMS_DHAKA.sql`
   - Copy ALL the SQL code
   - Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor

3. **Execute**
   - Click **"Run"** or press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) / `Cmd+Enter` (Mac)
   - Wait for confirmation: "Success. No rows returned"

4. **Verify** (Optional)
   - Run this query to confirm:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, price FROM rooms ORDER BY price;
   ```
   - You should see 9 rooms listed

### Step 2: That's It!
- The frontend is already configured to fetch from the database
- No code changes needed on the frontend
- Rooms will automatically appear in the app

## üìä What Was Changed

### Before (Hardcoded)
```typescript
// src/data/rooms.ts
export const rooms: Room[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "Standard", price: 24999, ... },
  { id: 2, name: "Deluxe", price: 39999, ... },
  // ... hardcoded data
];
```

### After (Database-Driven)
```typescript
// src/data/rooms.ts
export const rooms: Room[] = []; // Empty - fetch from DB

// src/pages/Rooms.tsx
const data = await roomsApi.getAllRooms(); // Fetches from Supabase
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Table: `rooms`
```sql
CREATE TABLE rooms (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    capacity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    size VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    bed_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    amenities TEXT[] NOT NULL,
    image_url TEXT,
    available BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üîß Managing Rooms After Setup

### Add a New Room
```sql
INSERT INTO rooms (name, description, price, capacity, size, bed_type, amenities, image_url, available) 
VALUES (
    'Garden Villa',
    'Private villa with garden access',
    119999.00,
    4,
    '1,500 sq ft',
    'King Bed',
    ARRAY['Private Garden', 'Free Wi-Fi', 'Butler Service'],
    '/garden-villa.jpg',
    true
);
```

### Update Room Price
```sql
UPDATE rooms 
SET price = 27999.00 
WHERE name = 'Standard Room';
```

### Mark Room as Unavailable
```sql
UPDATE rooms 
SET available = false 
WHERE id = 3;
```

### Delete a Room
```sql
DELETE FROM rooms 
WHERE id = 10;
```

### Get All Available Rooms
```sql
SELECT * FROM rooms 
WHERE available = true 
ORDER BY price;
```

### Get Rooms by Price Range
```sql
SELECT * FROM rooms 
WHERE price BETWEEN 30000 AND 70000 
ORDER BY price;
```

---

## üîç Verification Queries

### Check Total Rooms
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rooms FROM rooms;
-- Expected: 9
```

### Check Price Range
```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(price) as cheapest,
    MAX(price) as most_expensive,
    ROUND(AVG(price), 2) as average
FROM rooms;
-- Expected: Min: 24999, Max: 99999, Avg: ~61111
```

### Check Total Capacity
```sql
SELECT SUM(capacity) as total_guest_capacity FROM rooms;
-- Expected: 27 guests
```

### List All Rooms with Key Info
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    price,
    capacity,
    size,
    bed_type,
    available
FROM rooms 
ORDER BY price;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Success. No rows returned"
**Solution**: This is CORRECT! It means the insert was successful.

### Issue: "relation 'rooms' does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the full schema from `supabase-schema.sql` first.

### Issue: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
**Solution**: Rooms already exist. Either delete them first or skip this step.

### Issue: Rooms not showing in app
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
3. Check if `.env` has correct Supabase credentials
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Images not displaying
**Solution**: 
- JPG images (standard, deluxe, presidential) should be in `src/assets/`
- SVG images should be in `public/` folder
- Check image paths in the database match actual file locations
