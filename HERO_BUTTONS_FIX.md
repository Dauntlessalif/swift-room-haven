# âœ… Hero Section Buttons - Now Functional!

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed

The hero section buttons on the homepage were not functional. They are now fully working with proper navigation.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

**File Updated:** `src/components/HeroSection.tsx`

### Added Navigation:
```typescript
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const HeroSection = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleBookNow = () => {
    navigate('/rooms');
  };

  const handleExploreRooms = () => {
    navigate('/rooms');
  };
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### Updated Buttons:
```tsx
<Button 
  size="lg" 
  onClick={handleBookNow}  // âœ… Added click handler
  className="bg-gold hover:bg-gold/90..."
>
  Book Your Stay
</Button>

<Button 
  size="lg" 
  variant="outline"
  onClick={handleExploreRooms}  // âœ… Added click handler
