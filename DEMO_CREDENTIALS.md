### Option 2: Automated Setup (Development Only)

#### SQL Script for Demo Accounts
```sql
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Only use in development environment!
-- This bypasses normal authentication flow

-- Create demo customer (in auth.users table)
-- NOTE: Password hashing must be done through Supabase Auth API
-- Use the Supabase dashboard or sign-up UI to create these accounts

-- After creating accounts through UI, run this to complete setup:

-- 1. Update customer profile
UPDATE guests 
SET 
  first_name = 'John',
  last_name = 'Customer',
  phone = '+1 (555) 123-4567',
  address = '123 Demo Street, Demo City, DC 12345'
WHERE email = 'customer@demo.com';

-- 2. Grant admin privileges to admin account
UPDATE auth.users 
SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"is_admin": true}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'admin@swiftroomhaven.com';

-- 3. Update admin profile
UPDATE guests 
SET 
  first_name = 'Admin',
  last_name = 'User',
  phone = '+1 (555) 987-6543',
  address = 'Swift Room Haven HQ'
WHERE email = 'admin@swiftroomhaven.com';

-- 4. Create sample bookings for demo customer
INSERT INTO bookings (
  room_id, guest_id, check_in, check_out, 
  number_of_guests, total_amount, status, special_requests
)
SELECT 
  (SELECT id FROM rooms WHERE name LIKE '%Ocean%' LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM guests WHERE email = 'customer@demo.com'),
  CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '7 days',
  CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '9 days',
  2,
  450.00,
  'confirmed',
  'Demo booking - Ocean view preferred'
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM guests WHERE email = 'customer@demo.com');

INSERT INTO bookings (
  room_id, guest_id, check_in, check_out, 
  number_of_guests, total_amount, status, special_requests
)
SELECT 
  (SELECT id FROM rooms WHERE name LIKE '%Deluxe%' LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM guests WHERE email = 'customer@demo.com'),
  CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days',
  CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '28 days',
