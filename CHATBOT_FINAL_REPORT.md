# 🎉 ChatBot Enhancement - Final Report

## 📋 Project Overview
**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Task**: Fix input cutoff issue and add more features to hotel chatbot  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Build**: ✅ **PASSING**

---

## ✅ Problems Fixed

### 1. Input Box Cutoff Issue (RESOLVED)
**Original Problem**: The input box was getting cut off at the bottom of the chatbot window, making it difficult or impossible to type messages.

**Solution**:
- Changed from fixed height (`h-96`) to flexible height with max constraint
- Implemented proper flex container hierarchy:
  - Header: `flex-shrink-0` (never shrinks)
  - Messages: `flex-1 min-h-0` (grows/shrinks, scrollable)
  - Input: `flex-shrink-0` (always visible)
- Increased width from 320px to 384px for better readability
- Added explicit sizing to input field and send button

**Result**: Input box is now **always visible** and accessible on all screen sizes.
