# Swift Room Haven - Complete Setup Guide

## üéØ Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup Supabase Database

   - Visit: https://ziydtipspgbsrawpdvyi.supabase.co
   - Navigate to: SQL Editor (in left sidebar)
   - Click: "+ New Query"

2. **Execute the Database Schema**

   - Copy ALL the content (it's a long file!)
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter
   - Wait for success message (should take 5-10 seconds)

3. **Verify Database Setup**
   Run this query to verify all tables were created:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name 
   FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   ORDER BY table_name;
   ```
   
   You should see:
   - bookings
   - contact_messages
   - guests
   - pet_care_requests
   - reviews
   - rooms

### Step 2: Install & Run the Application

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: View Rooms
```sql
SELECT * FROM rooms;
```
Should return 3 rooms.

### Test 2: Create a Test Booking

```sql
-- 1. Create a test guest
INSERT INTO guests (first_name, last_name, email, phone, address)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@test.com', '+1234567890', '123 Test St')
RETURNING id;

-- 2. Create a booking (replace <guest_id> with ID from above)
INSERT INTO bookings (
  room_id,
  guest_id,
  check_in_date,
  check_out_date,
  number_of_guests,
  total_nights,
  total_price,
  status
) VALUES (
  1,  -- Presidential Suite
  '<guest_id>',  -- Replace with actual guest ID
  '2025-11-01',
  '2025-11-04',
  2,
  3,
  2697.00,
  'confirmed'
);

-- 3. View the booking
SELECT * FROM booking_details WHERE email = 'john.doe@test.com';
```

### Test 3: Check Availability
```sql
-- Check if room 1 is available for specific dates
SELECT check_room_availability(1, '2025-11-01', '2025-11-04');

-- Should return false if you created the booking above
-- Try different dates:

-- Should return true
```

### Test 4: Contact Message
```sql
INSERT INTO contact_messages (name, email, subject, message)
VALUES (
  'Test User',
  'test@example.com',
  'Test Subject',
  'This is a test message'
);

SELECT * FROM contact_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## üìà Useful Queries for Management

### View Today's Check-ins
```sql
SELECT * FROM booking_details 
WHERE check_in_date = CURRENT_DATE
AND booking_status = 'confirmed'
ORDER BY room_name;
```

### View Upcoming Bookings (Next 7 Days)
```sql
SELECT * FROM booking_details 
WHERE check_in_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE AND CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '7 days'
AND booking_status IN ('pending', 'confirmed')
ORDER BY check_in_date, room_name;
```

### Revenue Report (Current Month)
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
  SUM(total_price) as total_revenue,
  AVG(total_price) as avg_booking_value,
  SUM(total_nights) as total_room_nights
FROM bookings
WHERE booking_status NOT IN ('cancelled')
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE)
AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE);
```

### Popular Rooms
```sql
SELECT 
  r.name,
  r.price,
  COUNT(b.id) as booking_count,
  SUM(b.total_price) as total_revenue
FROM rooms r
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON r.id = b.room_id AND b.status != 'cancelled'
GROUP BY r.id, r.name, r.price
ORDER BY booking_count DESC;
```

### Guest Booking History
```sql
-- Replace with actual email
SELECT 
  first_name || ' ' || last_name as guest_name,
  email,
  COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
  SUM(total_price) as total_spent,
  MAX(check_out_date) as last_stay
FROM booking_details
WHERE email = 'john.doe@test.com'
GROUP BY guest_id, first_name, last_name, email;
```

### Unread Contact Messages
```sql
SELECT * FROM contact_messages 
WHERE status = 'new'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Pending Pet Care Requests

SELECT * FROM pet_care_requests 
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY start_date;
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "relation does not exist"
**Solution:** Run the complete `supabase-schema.sql` file again.

### Issue: Bookings not saving
**Problem:** RLS policy blocking inserts
**Solution:** Verify you're using the service role key (already configured in code)

### Issue: Can't see all bookings
**Problem:** Using anon key instead of service role
**Solution:** Check `src/lib/supabase.ts` - should use service_role key

### Issue: Dates not validating
**Problem:** Check constraints on bookings table
**Solution:** Ensure check-out date is after check-in date

## üîÑ Database Maintenance

### Clear Test Data
```sql
-- WARNING: This deletes all data!
TRUNCATE bookings, contact_messages, pet_care_requests, reviews CASCADE;
-- Guests are preserved (referenced by bookings)
```

### Reset Rooms to Default
```sql
-- Delete all bookings first
TRUNCATE bookings CASCADE;

-- Reset rooms
DELETE FROM rooms;

-- Re-run the INSERT statements from supabase-schema.sql
-- (Lines with INSERT INTO rooms...)
```

### Backup Important Data
```sql
-- Export bookings
SELECT * FROM booking_details;

-- Export guests
SELECT * FROM guests ORDER BY created_at;
```
